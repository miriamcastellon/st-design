# breadcrumb

!&gt; The _**Breadcrumb**_ displays the name of the current page and a link to its parent.

## Standard implementation

The parent will display the icon related to the type of gateway. In the case of the homepage, we will display a house.

?&gt; I think we're doing it wrong, because imho we should have something like Italy - Rome - Fiumicino.
