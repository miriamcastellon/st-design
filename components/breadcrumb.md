# Breadcrumb

## Standard implementation

{% hint style="info" %}
The _**Breadcrumb**_ displays the name of the current page and a link to its parent.
{% endhint %}

The parent will display the icon related to the type of gateway. In the case of the homepage, we will display a house.

{% hint style="info" %}
I think we're doing it wrong, because imho we should have something like Italy - Rome - Fiumicino.
{% endhint %}
