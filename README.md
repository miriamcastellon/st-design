The **Suntransfers Design System** is a living, breathing document that contains all of our visual assets \(components, iconography, color palettes, grids, etc\).

## Setup

* **Download the Kit.** Ask for access to the Suntransfers Style Guide Abstract repo and download it.
* **Open the Design Kit in Sketch.** Why Sketch? Sketch is the industry standard design tool for UI design. You can purchase a license for $99/year. If you don’t have a license for Sketch, you may sign up for a 30-day free trial. Sketch is easy to learn, and they offer many tutorials for further learning.
* **Using the Design Kit.** The Design Kit contains core visual styles, components, color swatches, iconography, and templates. It also has a collection of symbols and text styles for rapid design and layout prototyping. Each is designated its own page, which may be accessed via the left side panel.

## Releases

The Suntransfers Design team often makes improvements to the Design Kit. We track all release updates in our change log, so check back frequently!
