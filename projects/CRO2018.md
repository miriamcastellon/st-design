## Revamp: WHW value proposition content proposal


### Problem

There doesn't exist a value proposition that goes beyond the literal actions you can accomplish on the site. We only promise a cheap taxi where we could be selling a comfortable experience.

Based on [WHW][1] philosophy, we should define which is the **Why** of Suntransfers and how this message is communicated and informs everything we do on the site. The **How** and **What** parts are already defined and clear enough.

### Task

- Write the **Why** longer explanation to be placed below the reviews boxes.
- Write the promise based on the **Why** for the site header.
- Tweak the rest of the informative texts accordingly.

## 4. Form control error


### Problem

Losing focus on an input form with a blank value immediately triggers the _Required_ error. Is it best to show all errors on submit or display and correct them one by one?


### Tasks

- Investigate and decide on the best solution.
- Define a working process for both desktop and mobile.
- Create visuals to explain the process.

## 5. Stepper


### Problem

The _Stepper_ that displays the number of steps needed to finish your booking is not interactive. Propose a new design that contemplates adding more information and simple interaction or navigation to improve the booking experience.


### Tasks

- Clarify the needed steps to complete the booking and rename them accordingly if necessary.
- Decide on the amount of new information and possible useful interactions that could be incorporated.
- Define a working process for both desktop and mobile.
- Create visuals to explain the process.
